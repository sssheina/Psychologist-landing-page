## How we built it

We started by communicating with the customer and understanding the purpose in depth. I then designed the prototype and layout of the page in Figma. After prioritising, we divided the scope of work into small parts, which we distributed to the developers.

Parallax library "Rellax" was used to create the parallax effect. Also used "Swiperjs" library and  plugin "Smooth Scrollbar". PHP-mailer is used to send the form data to the psychologist's email. We made an adaptive page, used the SASS preprocessor, employed JS and worked with BEM.
<br>
<br>

## Challenges we ran into

We wanted to realise this project as best and fast as possible. For the customer it was the first experience of working with developers. I had to do the work of a marketer, copywriter and designer to get straight to the development of the page. And it took several months due to the client's force majeure. 
So it was difficult to quickly start drawing the layout and development. It was a good lesson in accepting and being realistic about the deadlines set.  

But we got it done! 
<br>
<br>

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We had an incredible experience working with the customer and the team. We pulled it off and are very proud to have created a beautiful, modern and functional adaptive website.
